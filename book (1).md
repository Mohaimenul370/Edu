Introduction

#### Introduction

Welcome to Stage 1 of **Cambridge Primary Mathematics**. We hope this
book will show you how interesting and exciting mathematics can be.

Mathematics is everywhere. Everyone uses mathematics every day.
Where have you noticed mathematics?

Have you ever wondered about any of these questions?

- Are the numbers we use when measuring the same as the numbers
    we count with?
- Why are the same 10 digits used to make all numbers
    (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9)?
- What is the difference between 2D and 3D shapes?
- How do you describe a pattern?
- How do you measure the passage of time?
- How do you solve a mathematics problem?

You will work like a mathematician to find the answers to some of these
questions. It is good to talk about
mathematics and share ideas as you
explore. You will reflect on what you did
and how you did it to think about
whether you would do the same next time.

You will be able to practise new skills and
check how you are doing and also challenge
yourself to find out more. You will be able to
make connections between what seem to
be different areas of mathematics.

We hope you enjoy thinking and working like
a mathematician.

#### Thinking and Working

#### Mathematically

**There are some important skills that you will develop as you learn
mathematics.**

```
Specialising
is when I test
examples to see if
they fit a rule or
pattern.
```
```
Characterising
is when I explain how
a group of things are
the same.
```
```
Classifying
is when I put things
into groups and can
say what rule
I have used.
```
```
Generalising
is when I can
explain and use a rule
or pattern to find
more examples.
```

```
Thinking and Working Mathematically
```
```
Critiquing
is when I think about
what is good and what
could be better in my
work or someone
else’s work.
```
```
Conjecturing is
when I think of an
idea or question linked
to my maths.
```
**Convincing**
is when I explain my
thinking to someone else,
to help them
understand.

```
Improving
is when I try to
make my maths
better.
```

#### 1 Numbers to 10


Numbers are all around us.

Sometimes a number is a label, like the number on a football shirt
or the number on a bus.

We count to find out how many there are.

A pack of 2 T-shirts shows 2 on the pack.

```
1 Numbers to 10
```

1 Numbers to 10

You need to say the numbers in the correct order to count.

To count objects, start with 1 and say a number for each object.

The last number you say tells you how many objects there are.

```
How many? 1, 2,...
```
```
1, 2, 3,... 4
```
```

class.
```
```
Let’s investigate
```
```
Look what I can do!
```
• I can count objects and write the matching number. (^)
• I can find or draw the correct number of objects. (^)

- I can say how many objects are in some sets without

counting. (^)
• I can give a good estimate of how many objects there are. (^)


```
1.2 Say, read and write numbers to 
```
Saying the numbers in a number rhyme is a
good way to learn the order of the numbers.

Exercise 1.

1 Say this number rhyme together.

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
Once I caught a fish alive!
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
Then I let it go again!
Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on the right.
```
2 Say your favourite number rhyme to a partner.

3 Count to 10. Point to each number as you say it.

Ask your partner to tell you what they do.


1 Numbers to 10

Exercise 1.3

```
Worked example 4
```
```
Compare the two sets. Look for what is the same or different.
Tick ✓ the set that has more objects.
```
```
Answer:
```
```
✓
```
```
I can match each shape
in one row with a shape
in the other row.
There is no match for the last shape
in the top row, so there are more
shapes in the top row than in the
bottom row. I need to
tick the top row.
```
You can compare different sets. You can find out which set has
more, fewer or the same number of objects as another set.

**Fewer** means the same as **less**.
**More** means the same as **greater**.

###### 1.3 Comparing numbers

```
We are going to ...
```
**- compare sets of objects and numbers.**

```
compare equal less
fewer more same
```

```
1.3 Comparing numbers
```
1 Compare the sets.

Tick ✓ the set that has fewer objects.

2 Compare the sets.

Tick ✓ the set that has fewer objects.

3 Compare the sets.

Tick ✓ the set that has more objects.


1 Numbers to 10

4 Compare the sets.

Tick ✓ the sets that have the same number of objects.

5 Compare the sets.

Complete the sentences.

10 Draw a ring around the correct number to complete each sentence.

```
To find a number that is more than a given number,
look along the number track towards the 1 / 10.
```
```
To find a number that is fewer than a given number,
look along the number track towards the 1 / 10.
```
If you were going to start your investigation again,
would you do anything differently?

```
Work with a partner or on your own.
Take 3 objects.
Take 1 more.
How many do you have now?
Take 1 more.
How many do you have now?
Repeat until you have 10 objects. What do you notice?
You have 10 objects.
Put 1 back.
How many do you have now?
Put another 1 back.
How many do you have now?
Repeat until you have 0 objects left. What do you notice?
```
```
Let’s investigate

```
1.4 Number words
```
###### 1.4 Number words

We can write numbers in words.

Coins often have words instead of numbers on them.

```
One Two Five Ten
```
```
We are going to ...
```
**- say, read and write numbers and number words to 10.**

```
zero: 0 one: 1 two: 2 three: 3 four: 4 five: 5
six: 6 seven: 7 eight: 8 nine: 9 ten: 10
```
```
We often use words instead of numbers in a story.
```
```
Look what I can do!
```
• I can compare two sets of numbers. (^)
• I can say which set has more or fewer (or greater or less). (^)

- I can recognise when two sets have the same number of

objects. (^)

Can you read and write all the number words correctly?

Do you find the word track, word ten frame or domino layouts
with number words helpful? Explain why.

```
All the number words from zero to ten have either 3, 4 or 5 letters
in the word.
Work with a partner to find out which number words have 3 letters,
4 letters or 5 letters.
```
```
Let’s investigate
```

```
1.5 Odd and even numbers

```
Continued
```
```
Look what I can do!
```
• I can read all the number words from zero to ten. (^)
• I can write some number words from zero to ten. (^)

###### 1.5 Odd and even numbers

```
We are going to ...
```
**- find out about odd and even numbers.**

There are different kinds of numbers.

Some numbers are called even numbers.
An even number of objects can be put into
pairs with none left over.

Some numbers are called odd numbers. An odd number of objects
always has 1 left over when the objects are put into pairs.

```
even odd pair pattern
```

```
1 Numbers to 10
```
Exercise 1.5

```
Worked example 5
Draw a ring around the correct word for 3.
Use some cubes to help you.
```
```
odd / even
```
```
Answer: 1 pair and 1 left over. 3 is an odd number.
```
1 Is each number odd or even? Draw a ring around the correct word.

```
8 odd / even
```
```
1 odd / even
```
```

```
2 Draw an odd number of counters on the ten frame.

Make it easy to see that it is odd.


```
1.5 Odd and even numbers
```
3 Colour the even numbers on the number track **red**.

Colour the odd numbers on the number track **blue**.

```
00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 1010
```
What pattern have you made?

4 Is each number odd or even?
Use the number track above to help you.

1 **odd / even** (^) 7 **odd / even**
(^) 4 **odd / even** (^) 10 **odd / even**
Do you need counters or other objects to find out if a number
is odd or even?
Explain to your partner how you use the counters.
Work in a group of four. Use the ten frame odd and even jigsaws
that you made in the classroom.
Put two numbers together to make ten, so that the ten frames are
whole again.
Discuss what you notice about the numbers in each ten frame.
**Let’s investigate**


1 Numbers to 10

```
Worked example 6
```
```
6 is the answer.
What could the question be?
```
```
Answer:
```
```
6
```
```
Which number is
4 fewer than 10?
```
```
What is the next
even number after 4?
```
```
Which number is
2 more than 4?
```
5 8 is the answer.
What could the question be?

```

#### 2 Geometry


**You are learning about 2D and 3D shapes so that you can use them
in different ways.**

**We live inside 3D shapes and we fill our homes, villages and towns
with 2D and 3D shapes. Making patterns with shapes will help you
to learn much more about them.**

###### 2.1 3D shapes

```
We are going to ...
```
**- describe and sort 3D shapes
- find what is the same and what is different about 3D shapes
- learn and use the right words for 3D shapes.**

**A 3D shape takes up space.**

**A cube is a 3D shape with 6 faces. Each face
is a square.**

**All the edges of a cube are the same length.**

**The base of a pyramid can be any straight-sided
shape, such as a square or a triangle.**

**The other faces are triangles that
meet at the top.**

**The number of faces depends on the shape
of the base.**

**Cylinders have two flat ends that are
both the same size and are circles.**

**The flat ends are joined by a surface
that is curved, not flat.**

**A cuboid is a 3D shape with 6 flat faces.**

**All of its faces are rectangles.**

**There are lots of other 3D shapes for you
to explore.**

12 Measures
```
**This unit is about measuring length, mass, capacity and temperature.**

**We measure different things in different ways.**

**Length looks at how long, short or high something is.**

**It can also be used to measure distance.**

**Mass looks at how heavy something is.**

**The mass of an object never changes.**

**Capacity looks at how much something can hold.**

**It looks at the space inside a container.**

**Temperature looks at how hot or cold something is.**


**12 Measures**

###### 12.1 Mass and capacity

```
We are going to ...
```
**- explore and compare mass
- explore and compare capacity.**

**The more mass an object has,
the heavier it is.**

**Capacity is how much an object
can hold.**

**This jug can hold more water than
the cup. It has a bigger capacity.**

```
Worked example 1
Which is heavier?

If you have 9 marbles and win 4 in a game,
it is better to count on 4 from 9 to see that you
have 13 rather than have to count them all.**

**Using a number line to help, you will be able to count on
from a number instead of having to count everything.**

16 Position, direction and patterns
```
**You are learning about position, pattern and direction so that you
can use them during your everyday life.**

###### 16.1 Position, direction and patterns

```
We are going to ...
```
**- use words to describe and continue patterns
- use words and actions to describe direction
- use words to describe position.**

**A sequence is a list of objects or numbers that are in a special order.**

**This order could be going forwards or backwards.**

**A sequence has a rule.**

**Sometimes it can have two rules.**

**Sequences and patterns have rules that we need to understand
so we know what comes next.**

**Patterns are everywhere.**

**We see them on our clothes, on our
walls, on our buildings and on flowers
and trees.**

**We see lots of patterns in maths too.**

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is
a sequence of
numbers.
